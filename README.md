##  Learning Roadmap

### Phase 1: The Theory (Lectures)
Deep dive into the core disciplines of cybersecurity. Each chapter includes "Pro Tips" and "Challenge Questions".
1.  [Intro to CTFs & Ethics](lectures/01_Intro_to_CTFs.md)
2.  [Cryptography](lectures/02_Cryptography.md)
3.  [Web Exploitation](lectures/03_Web_Exploitation.md)
4.  [Forensics](lectures/04_Forensics.md)
5.  [Reverse Engineering & Pwn](lectures/05_Reverse_Engineering_Binary.md)
6.  [Networking & Reconnaissance](lectures/06_Networking_Recon.md)

### Phase 2: The Training Ground (Practices)
Apply your knowledge in a structured lab environment.
*   **[CTF Field Manual](practices/General_Practices.md)**: A collection of hands-on labs following the Setup-Discovery-Exploitation-Assessment methodology.

### Phase 3: The Capstone Mission (IoT Red vs Blue)
An end-to-end simulation of an IoT ecosystem featuring a Live Dashboard, Security Forensics, and multiple attack vectors.
*   **[IoT Red vs Blue Project](projects/IoT_Red_Blue/README.md)**: The final challenge where all your skills are put to the test.
