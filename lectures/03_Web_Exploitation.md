# Chapter 3: Web Exploitation

Web exploitation challenges focus on finding and exploiting vulnerabilities in web applications.

## HTTP Basics
*   **Requests:** GET, POST, PUT, DELETE.
*   **Status Codes:**
    *   200: OK
    *   302: Redirect
    *   403: Forbidden
    *   404: Not Found
    *   500: Server Error
*   **Headers:** User-Agent, Cookie, Referer.

## OWASP Top 10 (Selected)

### 1. SQL Injection (SQLi)
Injecting malicious SQL queries to manipulate the database.
*   **Concept:** Input is not sanitized and is executed as code.
*   **Example:** `' OR 1=1 --` might bypass a login.
*   **Defense:** Use prepared statements (parameterized queries).

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
Injecting malicious scripts into websites viewed by other users.
*   **Reflected XSS:** Malicious script comes from the current HTTP request.
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious script is stored on the server (e.g., in a comment).
*   **Impact:** Stealing cookies (session hijacking), redirecting users.

### 3. Command Injection
Executing arbitrary system commands on the host operating system.
*   **Example:** A ping tool that executes `ping [input]`. If input is `8.8.8.8; ls`, it runs `ls` too.

### 4. Direct Object References (IDOR)
Accessing data by changing an ID in the URL.
*   **Example:** `site.com/profile?id=100` -> change to `id=101`.

## Tools
*   **Burp Suite:** Intercept and modify web traffic.
*   **Browser DevTools:** Inspect HTML, JS, and Network requests.
*   **curl:** Command line tool for making HTTP requests.
