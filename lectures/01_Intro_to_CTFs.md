# Chapter 1: Introduction to CTFs & Ethics

## What are CTFs?
Capture The Flag (CTF) competitions are cybersecurity exercises where participants are challenged to find "flags" hidden in vulnerable programs or websites.

### Types of CTFs
1.  **Jeopardy-Style:**
    *   Challenges are categorized (e.g., Web, Crypto, Pwn).
    *   Teams gain points for solving challenges.
    *   Most common format for beginners.
2.  **Attack-Defense:**
    *   Teams defend their own network while attacking others.
    *   Requires a balance of offensive and defensive skills.
    *   Real-time scoring based on service uptime and flags captured.
3.  **Mixed:**
    *   A combination of both formats.

## Ethics and Computer Law
Security professionals must operate within legal and ethical boundaries.

*   **Authorized Access:** Only test systems you have explicit permission to attack.
*   **Responsible Disclosure:** If you find a vulnerability in a real-world system, report it securely to the owner.
*   **White Hat vs. Black Hat:** understand the distinction between ethical hacking (defensive/authorized) and malicious hacking.

## Basic Skills
### Linux Command Line
The terminal is your primary tool.
*   `ls`, `cd`, `pwd`: Navigation
*   `cat`, `grep`, `less`: File reading
*   `chmod`, `chown`: Permissions
*   `ssh`: Remote access

### Virtual Machines
*   Use Kali Linux or Parrot OS as your attack environment.
*   Keep your host machine safe by isolating dangerous tasks in a VM.
