# Suggestions & Tips for Competition Success

## Before the Competition
1.  **Build a Team:** diverse skills are key. One person can't know everything.
2.  **Practice Together:** Solve challenges on HTB or TryHackMe as a group.
3.  **Prepare a Cheatsheet:** Have snippets of code for connecting to sockets, parsing text, etc., ready to go.
4.  **Template Scripts:** Have a basic Python script structure ready for solving challenges.

## During the Competition
1.  **Read Carefully:** 50% of the challenge is often understanding the question or clue.
2.  **Manage Time:** Don't get stuck on one rabbit hole for 4 hours. Switch challenges or ask a teammate to look with fresh eyes.
3.  **Sanity Check:** "Is it pluged in?" Check the simplest things first.
4.  **Take Breaks:** Your brain needs rest to solve complex logic puzzles. Drink water!
5.  **Scoreboard:** Watch the scoreboard to see which challenges other teams are solving—those might be the "low hanging fruit".

## After the Competition
1.  **Read Writeups:** See how other people solved the challenges you missed.
2.  **Write Your Own:** documenting your solution reinforces your learning and helps the community.
3.  **Analyze Mistakes:** What tool or concept were you missing? Add it to your study list.
